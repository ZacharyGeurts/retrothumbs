Use the green code button above and download zip for the whole thing.<BR />
Extract the zip and overwrite the Retroarch thumbnails folder.<BR />
Over 15,000 new and updated images, mostly new.<BR />
Retro video game thumbnails for Retroarch and others<BR />
Open a ticket if I am missing some thumbnails for a system. I have more around that I may be able to add.
